                    </h6>
                    <p class="text-justify">For any climb to be rated (receive a climb score/category) it must be 500
                        meters in length with an average
                        grade of 3% or more . Climbs are categorized from 4 (easiest) to beyond category (HC) most
                        difficult.
                        Map My Ride has added an additional category 5 rating. All climb scores are based on distance,
                        grade/elevation
                        change, and maximum elevation. The combination of these factors drives all final climb
                        categories
                        and there is no subjective analysis used in the final scoring of any climb score. All other
                        climbs
                        that do not meet the criteria for categorization are simply too small to rate and can usually be
                        crossed easily by bicycle, running or walking. Categorized climb ratings are given by the UCI
                        for
                        races like the Tour de France and other professional cycling events. There are only three
                        categorized
                        climbs involving Ride For Hope Idaho routes. All three of the climbs are rated as category 5
                        climbs
                        using Map My Ride methodology. Two of the climbs are on the Century Route and one climb is on
                        the
                        Metric Century course. Neither the 18 mile or 35 mile routes have climbs that are steep enough,
                        or
                        long enough, to categorize.
