There are 6 rest stops with ample opportunity to visit your favorite porta-john. The course has a little of everything including short climbs, rolling hills, and flats. You will trek southward and dip onto the Snake River Scenic Byway before returning to Melba and then on toward Marsing. With your fat cells crying (aka sweating) you will ride through vineyards, orchards and past scenic overlooks. You will skirt Lake Lowell as you head toward the finish line with your riding buddies; who will know more about your bodily functions than your significant other by the time you reach Kuna.'
